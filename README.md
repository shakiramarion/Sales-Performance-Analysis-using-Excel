# Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to understand customer purchasing patterns, leading to inefficient inventory management, suboptimal pricing strategies, and ineffective marketing efforts. Without data-driven insights, businesses may fail to identify seasonal demand fluctuations, customer preferences, and key sales trends. This project aims to analyze 1,000 retail transactions, examining factors such as product categories, customer demographics, and sales trends to uncover meaningful insights. By leveraging this data, businesses can optimize stock management, pricing models, and targeted marketing strategies, ultimately enhancing profitability and customer satisfaction.
